# Superfluid Finance Examples

This repositiory is dedicated to the example projects formerly located in the
protocol monorepo. The example projects in this repository are designed with
portability in mind. Developers should be able to use the components of these
examples to build scalable Superfluid applications.

## Getting Started

Each example has their own dependencies. This is to reduce complexity when using
one or a small number of examples from this repository.

To get started with any exmaple project, navigate to the appropriate example
directory and view the "Installation" section of its README file. Most projects
use `npm`, but others may use `forge` or another tool.

## New Example Requests

While the examples repository will focus on targeted parts of the protocol that
may not be simple to explain in documentation, we are open to suggestions on
improvements and additions to the repository! If you would like to request a new
example, open an issue and select the "New Example" template.
