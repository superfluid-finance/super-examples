### A basic example to get you started with the Superfluid Constant Flow Agreement

This example has a Youtube walkthrough to go along with it! You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mwbYQ429IU. Note that this tutorial only walks through the contract, not the Foundry test suite or package setup.

If you'd like to see a breakdown of the test file for this example, you can find a Youtube tutorial on this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_PGd8CPdfg&t=1s.

1. Run `forge install` to install
2. `forge build` to compile contracts
3. `forge test` to run the test suite.

Note: you might see an issue related to git when running forge install. If you see this error, try adding the `--no-commit` flag.
